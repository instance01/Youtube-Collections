# Youtube-Collections
Youtube Collections were removed, so I need a replacement. Can be adjusted to your needs rather easily by changing the channel names and playlist ids at line 25 (var channels = ..).

Example can be found [here](http://www.instancedev.com/yt_coll/). 

If you need a playlist id, simply go to the channel and click on Uploads, then copy the part shown in the following picture:
